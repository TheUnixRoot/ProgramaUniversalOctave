UMAFoL is a toolbox under construction that implements the main concepts of
formal languages theory. And is being developed at the University of Malaga,
hence its name.

INSTALLATION

  UMAFoL runs under Octave, which can be downloaded from

      http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html

  There is a GUI for Linux (QtOctave), but we recommend to work with gedit
  (configured for Octave files: View > Highlight mode > Scientific)
  and the terminal, the good-old-fashioned style.

  You'll need to setup the path (addpath + savepath).
